Hi, I'm Valeriia Kuka!

I'm a technical writer and content manager specializing in AI/ML, passionate about turning cutting-edge research into clear, practical guides that help people learn. I love exploring complex tech and tracing where groundbreaking ideas come from.

## Work Experience

Over the past four years, I've grown from leading social media to developing comprehensive content strategies, seeing all content channels as one big system that creates cohesive narratives across platforms.

For the past 2 years, I've been contributing pieces about cutting-edge AI/ML topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and [various prompting techniques](https://learnprompting.org/docs/introduction), Mamba, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). My [JEPA article](https://www.turingpost.com/p/jepa) was honored to receive [positive feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valeriia-kuka_im-thrilled-that-yann-lecun-mentioned-my-activity-7214878094174679040-XrCU) from JEPA's creator, Yann LeCun!

I've also contributed to AI unicorn profiles and historical series about AI and LLMs specifically. I believe this historical perspective is crucial because we're building on the legacy of past innovations.

Throughout my career, I've developed technical and research-focused social media channels (Twitter and LinkedIn), earning reposts from Stanford NLP, Amazon Research, Hugging Face, and AI researchers.

## Education

My B.Sc. in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics from Higher School of Economics gave me a solid foundation in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Machine Learning (check out my [final assignment project](github.com/kavaivaleri/Machine-Learning-Assignment)).

## Beyond Tech

Outside AI/ML publishing, I've:
- Volunteered at online research conferences
- Guided museum tours about Dostoevski in Saint Petersburg
- Coordinated editorial teams at a media platform about science and studying abroad, successfully hosting Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished researchers as contributors

I believe in building bridges between complex technical concepts and practical understanding, always striving to make AI/ML more accessible to everyone.
